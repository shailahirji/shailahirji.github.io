Salaams, 

Hope you're doing well. 

As per our discussion over the summer, I inquired at schools I am interested in for my Masters in CS. Below are the estimates the schools shared with me for the year 2019/2020

All Masters programs are expected to be a minimum of 2 years. 

University of British Columbia: $34,587 per year. Without expenses. 
University of Washington or Seattle University: $28,335 for 9 months without expense. 

Apologies for sending this in late.Got super busy with school and wanted to make sure I have all the correct information.
